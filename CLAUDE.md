# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**flow_ui** is a chat/assistant UI component library for Flutter — the presentation layer for AI assistant interfaces. It is a plain Flutter package (no codegen, no melos). Downstream packages depend on the public API exported from `lib/flow_ui.dart`, so treat it as a compatibility surface.

Two hard constraints shape everything here:

- **One third-party dependency: `google_fonts`.** `dependencies:` in `pubspec.yaml` holds the Flutter SDK, Flutter's own first-party packages — `material_ui` (Material's home since Flutter 3.47) and its transitive set, all published by flutter.dev — and `google_fonts` (material.io), which fetches Google Sans and Google Sans Code from Google Fonts at runtime. Nothing else, and no font files ship with the package. Dev dependencies (`flutter_test`, `flutter_lints`) are fine.
- **Nothing model-facing.** Components render state passed in and report intent out through callbacks. No prompts, schemas, provider/network calls, or any LLM awareness — that belongs to the layers built on top.

The theme, the conversation components (message, thread, streaming text, actions, loading), the composer and its menus, attachments with their preview, suggestions, and the chat surface are implemented; the roadmap below tracks the rest. Message content is modeled as typed parts (`lib/src/models/`) — sealed `FlowMessagePart` subtypes rendered by `FlowMessage`, with `FlowCustomPart` + `FlowCustomPartBuilder` as the extension seam for host-injected content.

## Layout

- Package at the repo root: `lib/`, `test/`, `pubspec.yaml`.
- `playground/` — the Flow UI Playground: a full Flutter app depending on the package via `path: ../`. Use it to demo and manually exercise components (every component has a stage demo, with variant pills and code snippets).

## Commands

**Don't write tests for now.** `test/` is deliberately empty — the component surface is still being reshaped design-first, so tests written now would mostly encode values about to change. Verify a change with `flutter analyze` and by exercising it in the `playground/` app, not by adding a test file. If something seems to genuinely need one, say so and let the user decide.

From the repo root:

```bash
flutter analyze
dart format .
flutter test                                  # all tests (see above — none yet)
```

Playground app:

```bash
cd playground
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome    # or any device
```

## Commits

Commit messages are conventional commits with a brief summary line:
`feat: <brief-commit-message>` — `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:` as
appropriate. Add a body only when a decision genuinely needs recording, and
never any AI attribution.

## Component roadmap

Status legend: ⬜ Todo · ✅ Done

### Theme (build first)

`ThemeExtension`-based design tokens for **colors and typography**; every component consumes these two token sets (no hardcoded colors or text styles). Spacing and corner radii are deliberately *not* tokens: following Material's structure, each component bakes its own metrics from the Figma file as private spec constants and exposes per-widget overrides (`padding:`, `borderRadius:`) where hosts retheme.

Values come from the Flow UI Figma file. Role names follow Material 3's `ColorScheme` so a host can map an existing scheme across; Flow adds a third ink level (`onSurface` / `onSurfaceVariant` 75% / `onSurfaceMuted` 50%), `success` / `warning` groups beside `error`, and a `shadow` role (the ink at 2%, alpha included) that the composer, the menu card, attachment tiles and the jump disc draw their shadows with. Three rules hold the palette together: the ink ramp, the outlines (`outline` the faint hairline, `outlineVariant` the firm one) and the container ladder `Lowest → Highest` are **translucent** ink washes, so the same label, hairline and fill read correctly on the page and on a raised card; accent containers are their accent at 8% (statuses 6%) with the accent as the `on` colour; and the grounds — `surface` and `surfaceBright` — are **opaque**. The raised card — the composer, menus, sheets — sits on `surfaceBright` (white / `#1E1E1E`), the one surface that lifts off the page in both themes.
